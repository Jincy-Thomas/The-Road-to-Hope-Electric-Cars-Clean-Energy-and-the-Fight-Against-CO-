# The Road to Hope: Electric Cars, Clean Energy, and the Fight Against CO₂

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how the global shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) impacts carbon emissions and the clean energy transition. Using historical EV adoption data (2010–2024) and growth projections to 2030, I examined global trends, compared country-level adoption rates, and evaluated how clean electricity grids influence the real climate benefits of electrified transport.

The analysis highlights both early leaders (e.g., Norway) and fast-growing late movers (e.g., Brazil, India, Turkey), showing how increasing EV penetration combined with renewable energy can significantly reduce CO₂ emissions.

## Data Source
- **Dataset:** Electric car stocks (2010–2024)
- **Primary Source:** International Energy Agency (IEA), *Global EV Outlook 2025*
- **Access & Processing:** Our World in Data (OWID)
- **Link:** Our World in Data – Electric car stocks

The dataset provides annual country-level estimates of the percentage of car fleets that are electric, enabling trend analysis, forecasting, and cross-country comparisons.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared multi-country EV adoption datasets
- Calculated annual growth rates and adoption percentages
- Identified early adopters vs fastest-growing markets
- Compared adoption with electricity generation mix
- Estimated potential CO₂ reduction impacts
- Created visualizations and wrote a data-driven blog post to communicate findings

---

## Key Findings
- Global EV share grew from <0.01% (2010) to ~6% (2024)
- Projected to exceed 13% by 2030
- Norway leads due to strong policy + renewable hydropower grid
- Late adopters show >80–120% annual growth
- EVs deliver the largest CO₂ reductions when powered by clean energy
