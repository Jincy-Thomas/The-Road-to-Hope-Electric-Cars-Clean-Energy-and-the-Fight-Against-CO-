# The Road to Hope: Electric Cars, Clean Energy, and the Fight Against CO₂

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how the global shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) is reshaping the carbon emissions outlook. Using historical EV adoption data and projections to 2030, I examined global trends, compared early leaders and late movers, and evaluated how clean electricity generation influences real climate benefits. The results are presented through data visualizations and a written analysis that highlights the potential for EV adoption to reduce CO₂ emissions when paired with renewable energy.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on:

- **Our World in Data – Electric car stocks dataset**  
  https://archive.ourworldindata.org/20250909-093708/grapher/electric-car-stocks.html  
  *(Processed version of IEA data used for analysis)*

- **International Energy Agency – Global EV Outlook 2025 (data source)**  
  https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/global-ev-outlook-2025  
  *(Original data source for electric vehicle adoption statistics)*

The dataset provides annual estimates of electric vehicle shares in car stocks across countries and regions, enabling trend analysis, forecasting, and cross-country comparisons.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
  - pandas – data cleaning & analysis  
  - matplotlib – visualization  
  - statsmodels – time-series forecasting (Holt-Winters / Exponential Smoothing)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub

## What I Did

- Collected and merged electric vehicle adoption and energy mix data  
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent values using Python (pandas)  
- Calculated adoption percentages, annual growth rates, and country comparisons  
- Identified early adopters (e.g., Norway) and fastest-growing markets (e.g., Brazil, India, Turkey)  
- Explored how grid electricity mix affects the climate impact of EV adoption  
- Built visualizations to highlight key patterns and insights  
- Translated technical findings into a data-driven blog post

## Key Insights

- Global EV share grew from <0.01% (2010) to ~6% (2024) with ~13% projected by 2030  
- Norway leads global adoption due to strong policy and a renewable electricity grid  
- Late adopter markets are achieving very high growth rates (>80–120% annually)  
- EVs deliver the largest CO₂ reductions when paired with clean energy sources  
- Each additional percentage point of EV adoption can translate into millions of tonnes of avoided CO₂ emissions
